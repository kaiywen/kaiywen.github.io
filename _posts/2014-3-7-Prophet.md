You have been told also that life is darkness,
and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.

And I say that life is indeed darkness
save when there is urge,

And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,

And all knowledge is vain save where there is work,

And all work is empty save when where is love;

And when you work with love you blind yourself
to yourself, and to one another, and to God...

Work is love made visible.

And if you cannot work with love but only with distances,
it is better that you should leave your work
and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those
who work with joy.

-- The Prophet
